# EPANET_Python_Wrapper

This is a python wrapper for EPANET software, and the lib is in epanet folder which is generated from owa_epanet project; see https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet-python/tree/dev/owa-epanet for details.

With SWIG, this wrapper can be updated along with the source code of EPAENT project, and it would offer all functions EPAENT software has, but in the python version.

We also provide several examples to illustrate how to use this wrapper.
